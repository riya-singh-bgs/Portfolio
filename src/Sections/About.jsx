          I&apos;m a developer who thrives on crafting accessible,{" "}
          <span className="text-white">pixel-perfect user interfaces</span> that
          seamlessly blend <span className="text-white">thoughtful design</span>{" "}
          with robust engineering. My passion lies at the crossroads of
          development and design, shaping experiences that are both visually
          engaging and meticulously optimized for{" "}
          <span className="text-white">performance and usability.</span>
          <br />
          <br /> Recently, I completed an intensive{" "}
          <span className="text-white">internship</span> building modern web
          applications using the <span className="text-white">MERN stack</span>,
          where I specialized in <span className="text-white">React.js</span>{" "}
          and contributed to the development and refinement of dynamic{" "}
          <span className="text-white">UI components.</span> I&apos;m dedicated
          to maintaining web accessibility standards and best practices, aiming
          to deliver inclusive experiences on every project.
          <br />
          <br />
          Previously, I've built products and applications across a range of
          environmentsâ€”from
          <span className="text-white">collaborative college teams</span> and
          <span className="text-white">
            freelance projects for small businesses
          </span>
          , to
          <span className="text-white">participating in hackathons</span>. Along
          the way, I've helped peers build their portfolios and guided newcomers
          through core
          <span className="text-white">JavaScript</span> and
          <span className="text-white">React concepts</span>. <br />
          <br /> When I&apos;m not coding, you&apos;ll find me solving <span className="text-white">LeetCode
          problems</span>, designing UIs, exploring new component libraries, enjoying
          music, or unwinding with games and movies.
